This is the third assignment of course CT80A0000 Data-Intensive Systems. The database utilizes Postgresql, and the frontend uses Python. The **dbInit.py** file connects to Postgresql, creates the required databases and tables, and populates them with dummy data.
After running dbInit.py, the data can be accessed from the **main.py** frontend file.
